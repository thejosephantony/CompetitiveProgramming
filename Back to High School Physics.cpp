/*A particle has initial velocity and constant acceleration. If its velocity after certain time is v then what will its displacement be in twice of that time?

Input
The input will contain two integers in each line. Each line makes one set of input. These two integers denote the value of v (-100 ≤ v ≤ 100) and t(0 ≤ t ≤ 200) ( t means at the time the particle gains that velocity). The end of the input is determined by EOF.

Output
For each line of input print a single integer in one line denoting the displacement in double of that time.*/
